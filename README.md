# Build-an-Object-Detection-Web-App-with-YOLOv8-and-Streamlit
In this project, we'll use YOLOv8 .We'll create a simple web application using the web app framework Streamlit and the computer vision library OpenCV. The app enables us to upload a video, identify objects in the frame, and provide information about the detected objects using bounding boxes around the detected objects.
