# Object Detection Web App with YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Streamlit

![Demo](https://github.com/radhika3131/Build-an-Object-Detection-Web-App-with-YOLOv8-and-Streamlit/assets/102825662/3bde145b-b72a-4a0a-bd64-86404e038f73)



## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of an Object Detection Web App using the YOLOv8 model, OpenCV, and Streamlit. The app allows users to upload a video, identify objects in each frame, and visualize the results with bounding boxes and labels.

## Features

- **YOLOv8 Integration**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model for accurate object detection.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading videos and visualizing detection results.
- **Custom Object Selection**: Users can choose specific objects for detection.
- **Confidence Score Control**: Allows users to set a confidence score threshold for filtering detections.
- **Bounding Box Visualization**: Draws bounding boxes around detected objects with labels.
- **Video Processing**: Applies object detection to each frame of the uploaded video.
- **Save Processed Video**: Saves the processed video with annotated results.
- **Interactive Demo**: [ Medium ](https://medium.com/@radhikaramsen3131/build-an-object-detection-webapp-with-yolov8-and-streamlit-29dd2d09be26)

## Configuration
Model: The YOLOv8 model is loaded from the yolov8n.pt file. Replace it with your own trained model if needed.
